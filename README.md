## Data

To download the source data for the ALS and WH datasets, type
```bash
make data
```

The other datasets require data usage agreements and so cannot be shared via this repository.


## Set up precommit hook to remove notebook outputs


This is important both to simplify our commits and to make sure that we don't
commit information that should not be committed

    pip install pre-commit
    pre-commit install
